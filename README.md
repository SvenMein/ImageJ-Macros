# Introduction
This repository contains different ImageJ/Fiji macros which were written during my Ph.D. or in the time after that. A macro is a simple program that automates a series of ImageJ commands.  They can be used to:
+ automate repetitive tasks
+ document what you did
+ simplify sharing procedures/analysis
